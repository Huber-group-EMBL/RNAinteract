Description: RNAinteract estimates genetic interactions from
        multi-dimensional read-outs like features extracted from
        images. The screen is assumed to be performed in multi-well
        plates or similar designs. Starting from a list of features
        (e.g. cell number, area, fluorescence intensity) per well,
        genetic interactions are estimated. The packages provides
        functions for reporting interacting gene pairs, plotting
        heatmaps and double RNAi plots. An HTML report can be written
        for quality control and analysis.
